AnyPOI is an iPhone App & Apple Watch App to find and manage your Point Of Interests and to create travels.

Incredibly useful to prepare your next holidays or professional trips or just to keep in mind your best restaurants, viewpoints or anything you like.
It’s easy to use, there’s no need of an account, everything is stored locally on your iPhone and can be protected with Touch ID/Face ID or a password.
Sharing points of interests & trips with friends is also a key feature of AnyPOI.
